==========

ionic-shop is an open-source shopping cart and checkout library meant to be used with the ionic-framework

It is a library of directives and services that help integrate products with an easy to use shopping cart and checkout process. 

The ionic-shop currently offers integration with stripe and will soon offer integration with google wallet and paypal.

i.e : ```<script src="ion-cart.js"></script>```

# Use:

The ionic-shop use:

## ion-cart

The ion-cart is a shopping cart directive that should be placed within an ion-content element. In order to use the ion-cart, you must attach a products attribute/isolate scope to the element that is set equal to an array of product objects like so:

```
<ion-content>
 <ion-cart products='productArray'></ion-cart>
</ion-content>
```

The product Array should have objects with the following fields:
```
{
  title: 'product name',
  description: 'product description',
  quantity: integer (number of products added),
  price: integer (per unit price of the product),
  images: (An array of strings containing the path to your image url),
  id: an optional field to give each product a unique id 
}
```

Additionally, the ion-cart comes with an image-slider modal that pops up when a user clicks/touches the image.

## ion-cart-footer

The ion-cart-footer directive should be placed after the ion-content in your application. It replaces the normal ion-footer element. The ion-cart-footer takes a path attribute/isolate scope that is set equal to a state specified in your ui-router like so.

```
<ion-header></ion-header>
<ion-content>
  <ion-cart products='productArray'></ion-cart>
</ion-content>
<ion-cart-footer path='checkout'></ion-cart-footer> 
```

In the example above, on-click, the application will call $state.go('checkout').

## ion-checkout

The ion-checkout directive is a checkout form content with field validations. The default fields are: Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVC number. Validation is performed on all fields automatically on blur. Additionally, as a convenience, the ion-checkout directive displays the total cost of all the items in the ion-cart. The directive can be used like so:

```
<ion-content>
  <ion-checkout></ion-checkout>
</ion-content>
```

The ion-checkout directive comes with a few options:

#### has-email

The has-e-mail attribute/directive attaches an e-mail field to the ion-checkout. Email field comes with validation. 

```
<ion-checkout has-email></ion-checkout>
```

#### has-address

The has-address attribute/directive attaches an address field to the ion-checkout. Address fields come with zipcode validation

```
<ion-checkout has-address></ion-checkout>
```

#### has-name

The has-name attribute/directive attaches a first and last name field to the ion-checkout.

```
<ion-checkout has-name></ion-checkout>
```

## checkout-footer 

*** Currently you must have a Stripe Account to use this feature.

The checkout-footer directive validates checkout field inputs and calls on the StripeService to create a stripe token for the checkout form using the Stripe public key that you set using the StripeService.setStripeKey method and a callback created by settings a function equal to the StripeService.setStripeTokenCallback method like so:

```
StripeService.setStripeKey(stripeKey);
StripeService.setStripeCallback = function(status, response){
  // Proccess the response
});
```
